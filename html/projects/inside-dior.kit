                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">In the run-up to London Fashion Week 2017, More4 screened Inside Dior, a two-part observational documentary series
                        which took an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the fashion house on its 70th birthday and the appointment of its
                        first female creative director.</p>
                        <h2 class="tpr-article-content__subtitle">Project: </h2>
                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">Our brief was to raise awareness of Inside Dior and drive an audience to the series as well as to reinforce the
                        reputation of Finestripe and the filmmakers. We pinned down high-visibility exposure in nationals and weekly magazines,
                        including the Telegraph and Grazia, as well as appearances on BBC Breakfast and Woman’s Hour. There were high-levels of
                        engagement on social media as a result of clips which were carefully placed, as well as relationship building with high
                        profile commentators (Suzy Menkes and Justine Picardie).</p>
