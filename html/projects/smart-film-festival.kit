                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">The team behind the first smartphone film to win an academy award (Missed Call, TV BAFTA) launched SMART &ndash; the first London International Smartphone Film Festival in April 2021. SMART celebrates the innovation, intimacy and diversity of Smartphone filmmaking. There were six categories covering scripted and unscripted films of all lengths and genres. The winners were judged by high profile jury members including Adrian Dunbar (Line of Duty), Alex Lawther (The Imitation Game) and Sophie Fiennes (documentary filmmaker). SMART's inaugural year took place between 21-25 June 2021 in an online festival of screenings and a series of events. </p>
