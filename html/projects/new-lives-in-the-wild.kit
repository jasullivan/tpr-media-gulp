                        <p class="tpr-article-content__details">Programme: Ben Fogle: New Lives in the Wild</p>
                        <p class="tpr-article-content__details">Date: January 2022</p>
                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">Marking a decade on air, adventurer Ben Fogle set off to meet more people who have turned their back on the rat-race and set up home in remote locations in the UK and beyond in Ben Fogle: New Lives In The Wild. He joined a variety of brave individuals who chose to venture down a very alternative path to everyday life. We watched as Ben travelled from a remote Portuguese mountain to a real life nomad land in the Arizonian desert. Throughout the eleven-part series, Ben seeks to discover the motivation and reality of abandoning a life dominated by debts and daily grind in search of something different. A commonly occurring theme sees nature as solace from the often harsh realities of the fast-paced world we live in. The series sensitively addresses discussions of mental wellbeing and how the natural environment can provide an alternative 'cure'.</p>
