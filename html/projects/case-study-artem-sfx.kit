                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">tpr media has been working with Artem since 2012 when the company was contracted to provide a vast range of effects for the London Olympics opening and closing ceremonies, from giant puppet to a 50m inflatable octopus. Since then, we have worked to highlight the range of Artem’s work in trade media, alongside national, online, TV and radio.</p>

                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">Coverage highlights have included a feature in the Mail on Sunday’s Event magazine, a video news story on the BBC News Entertainment & Arts site (‘How to blow up a car and other film special effects’), profile pieces in London-based publications, including the Evening Standard, Time Out and Stylist, and a cover story for 3D Digital.</p>
