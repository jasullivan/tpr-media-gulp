                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">Scotland's leading natural history production company, Maramedia, made Born to be Wild &ndash; a heart&#8208;warming ten&#8208;part factual series celebrating nature and wildlife in Britain's largest and most advanced rescue centre. The series combines heart-warming stories of animals in trouble and the committed staff who care for them, with stunning wildlife cinematography.</p>
                        <h2 class="tpr-article-content__subtitle">Project: </h2>
                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">The aim was to raise awareness and drive a wider audience than usual to this new strand as well as tapping into the increasing public appetite for wildlife conservation and "feel good" TV shows and raising the industry profile of Maramedia. We obtained wide ranging media coverage across TV, radio, print and online with 43 pieces. Highlights of the campaign included a feature in the Daily Mirror, an i-news feature, and an online 'feeding frenzy' compilation in the Daily Mirror online. There were TV sofa interviews with contributors on both BBC Breakfast and BBC Look North and four radio interviews including BBC Radio 5 Live Breakfast and the Jo Good Show on BBC London. Trade coverage was an important part of the campaign and there were three pieces in Broadcast &ndash; a behind&#8208;the&#8208;scenes feature about the production of the series which appeared in the magazine, an And Finally...' Q&A by Nigel Pope; and an online story about BBC Scotland recommissioning the series.
