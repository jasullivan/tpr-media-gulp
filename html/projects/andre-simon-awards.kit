                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph"> The Andr&#233; Simon Awards were founded in 1978 to recognise the achievements of food and drink writers. They are the longest running awards of their kind. Previous winners have included: Elizabeth David and Rosemary Hume (the very first winners), Michel Roux, Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, Nigel Slater and Rick Stein.</p>
                        <h2 class="tpr-article-content__subtitle">Project: </h2>
                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">The long-term aim of our work with the prestigious award ceremony is for the Andr&#233; Simon Memorial Fund to be involved in national conversations about trends in food, drink and cooking through its staff, judges and winners and reflect the diversity of contemporary Britain. Since 2014, we have built strong relationships with trade and consumer media including The Bookseller and the Guardianâ€™s weekly Cook supplement.</p>
