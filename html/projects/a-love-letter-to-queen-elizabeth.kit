                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">Duty: A Love Letter to Queen Elizabeth II (published 7 April 2022, £35, whitefox) showcases the work of artist Owen Grant Innes, who, as a child, growing up in Nova Scotia, struggled to understand how and where he fitted in. The Queen connected him to a wider world beyond his own and provided a sense of belonging. The book comprises 27 artworks at various stages of the Queen's life: from birth to her coronation to being at home with her beloved corgis. It captures both personal and public moments. Duty: A Love Letter to Queen Elizabeth II looks back at iconic moments in her life and pays tribute to her 70 year reign on her Platinum Jubilee in 2022.</p>
