                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">The Tinderbox - Israel & Palestine: The Untold Story is the directorial debut from Gillian Mosely and a deeply personal journey of one woman forced to challenge everything she’d been taught about her own history. The film is the culmination of three decades spent studying and questioning one of the world’s most complex conflicts.  As a British-American Jew raised in a strongly Zionist household, director Gillian Mosely thought she understood the Israeli-Palestinian conflict: its roots and repercussions, and the different sides involved. But a chance encounter with a Palestinian man – who would later become a close friend – prompted the film producer to reconsider her beliefs.It provides a thought-provoking look at history both ancient and modern. Made by Mosely’s production company Medialab, in partnership with Spring Films and distributed by Dartmouth Films. </p>
