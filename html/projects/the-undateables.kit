                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">tpr media was responsible for promoting the first three series of Channel 4’s The Undateables and creating a brand for this award-winning series about dating and disability. There was a delicate balance to be struck between being tasteful and provocative. Our contributors – who were all looking for a relationship with someone special – had a range of disabilities, some physical, some mental, and it was important for us to engage them in the campaign and for them to have input in how it should run.</p>
                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">The title – The Undateables – is Channel 4 at its provocative best and designed to stimulate debate. Many of the contributors liked this because they said that too often disabled people are not heard but ‘The Undateables’ couldn’t be ignored. In fact, in the series titles the ‘Un’ prefix of Undateables is dislodged by ‘cupid’s arrow’, making the contributors dateable. The campaign, across all three series, was at heart human interest and case-study led. We provided media training for contributors who appeared on TV sofas – Good Morning Britain, This Morning, Lorraine and in articles in the Guardian and The Sun.</p>
