This film follows the passion, determination, and unwavering commitment of people who aren't putting their heads in the sand, they aren't waiting for someone else to do something: they’re in the trenches making an impact. The Race to Save The World was launched on 22 April, World Earth Day and will inspire viewers to stop waiting on the sidelines and make their voices heard for a sustainable future.</p>
