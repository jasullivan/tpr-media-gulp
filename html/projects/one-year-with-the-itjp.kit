                        <p class="tpr-article-content__details">Date: 2021 - 2022</p>
                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">At tpr media we are committed to creating intelligent campaigns for projects with a social impact. Weâ€™ve been working with human rights organisation the International Truth and Justice Project (ITJP) for several years now and have worked on a variety of releases and campaigns. The ITJP is an international, non-profit organisation working since 2013 to protect and promote justice and accountability in Sri Lanka. They are headed by director and world-renowned human-rights defender Yasmin Sooka and executive director and former BBC foreign correspondent Frances Harrison. They comprise award-winning human rights lawyers, journalists, researchers and trauma experts who collectively document war crimes and ongoing human rights violations.</p>

                        <h2 class="tpr-article-content__subtitle">Campaign Overview:</h2>

                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">Over the past year tpr media have worked on over 10 different major campaigns and events including the release of detailed reports in to the atrocities of former Sri Lankan president Gotabaya Rajapaksa and a report on torture and sexual violence by Sri Lankan security forces. We have also worked to gain coverage on criminal complaints and legal action carried out by the ITJP and human rights lawyers. During this time,  there has been a total of over 500+ pieces of coverage on the ITJP within UK, international and Sri Lankan regional press across print, online, TV and radio as well as news agencies AP and Reuters. Through tailored PR campaigns we have helped to build the profile of the ITJP as a leading player when discussing Sri Lankan Human Rights abuses.</p>

                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">Some of the key coverage over the past year includes <a class="tpr-article-content__link" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/exclusive-rights-group-seeks-arrest-former-sri-lanka-president-rajapaksa-2022-07-24/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Reuters</a>, <a class="tpr-article-content__link" href="https://apnews.com/article/crime-arrests-race-and-ethnicity-united-nations-bc8adcd82235bfb7cc794cb65a4e21df" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">AP News</a>, <a class="tpr-article-content__link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/30/fall-of-sri-lankan-president-gotabaya-rajapaksa-raises-victims-hopes" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">The Guardian</a>, <a class="tpr-article-content__link" href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/7/24/rights-group-seeks-arrest-of-former-sri-lanka-president" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Al Jazeera</a>, BBC World Service, Times Radio, CNN and New York Times as well as a large selection of other international and Sri Lankan press.</p>
