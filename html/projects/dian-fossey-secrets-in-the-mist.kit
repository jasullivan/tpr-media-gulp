                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">tpr media provided a campaign designed to raise awareness and drive an audience to the series &ndash; this was done to a tight turnaround. This comprehensive campaign included a drive to get blanket TV previews and reviews as well as a comment piece in Broadcast on quality international drama. We also worked with contributors to identify a number of angles to bring the series to life across print, TV, radio and online media. This included interviews with Dian Fossey’s young researcher, Ian Redmond, in <a class="tpr-article-content__link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/life/secrets-mist-murdered-dian-fossey/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">The Telegraph</a> and on <a class="tpr-article-content__link" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b09jqtp9" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">BBC Radio 4’s Saturday Live</a> and The World Tonight. tpr was also involved in the press screening for the film which was attended by the Director Zara Hayes and Executive Producer James Mars.</p>
