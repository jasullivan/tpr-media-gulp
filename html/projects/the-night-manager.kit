                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">The Night Manager is a six-part drama series directed by Susanne Bier and starring Tom Hiddleston, Hugh Laurie, Olivia
                        Colman, David Harewood, Tom Hollander, and Elizabeth Debicki. It is based on the 1993 novel of the same name by John Le
                        Carré and adapted by David Farr to the present day.</p>
                        <h2 class="tpr-article-content__subtitle">Project: </h2>
                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">tpr media worked with international publicity teams on the launch of this acclaimed BBC/AMC drama. The scope of our
                        brief was to ensure visibility for director Susanne Bier’s in the press coverage around the project, positioning her as
                        an intelligent, creative and successful female director. We had to collaborate extensively with invested parties to
                        avoid placing interviews that would clash with slots focusing on Hugh Laurie and Tom Hiddleston. Coverage included an
                        interview in The Times T2 about bringing Le Carré’s novel to life as well as a major focus on the series in Televisual
                        and a behind-the-scenes interview in Broadcast magazine.</p>
