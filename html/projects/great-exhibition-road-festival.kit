                        <p class="tpr-article-content__details">Date: March to June 2019</p>
                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">In June 2019, the first Great Exhibition Road Festival 2019 was launched. South Kensington's Exhibition Road &ndash; the first cultural quarter in the world &ndash; hosted a celebration of curiosity and discovery, with a new, free festival of art, science and culture, transforming the area, with interactive workshops, behind&#8208;the&#8208;scenes tours and exciting talks. The festival marked the bicentenary of the births of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, taking inspiration from their vision for the Great Exhibition of 1865.</p>
                        <h2 class="tpr-article-content__subtitle">Project: </h2>
                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">tpr media was commissioned to develop and implement a PR campaign with the principal aim of driving visitors to the Great Exhibition Road Festival in its launch year, focussing on the 'bigger picture' and broad themes; liaising with a core team at Imperial. We gained 95 pieces of wide-ranging media coverage across TV, radio, print and online, from BBC TV London news to BBC Radio 4 Loose Ends; The Observer to Mail Online; Time Out to Londonist Grazia to BBC History Revealed. The results exceeded the key performance indicators for London and national media.
