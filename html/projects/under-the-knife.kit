                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">tpr launched the premiere of Under the Knife, a 90&#8208;minute documentary, that tells the story of how the NHS arrived at its present-day crisis. Narrated by award&#8208;winning actor, Alison Steadman, and endorsed by film director, Ken Loach, Under the Knife was released in a festival of screenings in over 70 venues in collaboration with campaigning organisation Keep Our NHS Public.</p>
                        <h2 class="tpr-article-content__subtitle">Project: </h2>
                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">tpr was commissioned to raise awareness of the screenings of Under the Knife, encourage the public to see the film, generate debate and raise awareness of campaigning organisation, Keep Our NHS Public (KONP). We secured a media partnership with campaigning newspaper The Mirror which ran two high profile pieces including a spread with Alison Steadman. Mirror Associate editor, Kevin Maguire, chaired the Under the Knife premiere Q&A and mentioned the film in his Mirror column and on social media. Other coverage included a mention in John Le Fanu's Telegraph column, Pam Kleinot's blog in Open Democracy (81.3k twitter), and a blog in Live for Films (57.2k followers) by director Susan Steinberg. The British Medical Journal and the Health Service Journal also covered the film's release. In total, there were just over 50 pieces of coverage, with over 30 regional pieces of press.
