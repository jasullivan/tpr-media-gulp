                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph"> BBC Two’s multi award-winning Secret History of Our Streets told the story of six London streets, from Victorian times to the present day. For the second series, Secret Streets travelled to Scotland to tell the stories of three archetypal streets in Scotland’s three great cities: Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen.</p>
                        <h2 class="tpr-article-content__subtitle">Project: </h2>
                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">At short notice, tpr media were commissioned to promote The Secret History of Our Streets: Scotland two weeks before transmission. The campaign attracted blanket coverage across national newspapers, listings and consumer magazines in previews and reviews, many tying in with the topical Commonwealth Games which took place in Glasgow. The series was a critical success and all three episodes consistently received four or five-star reviews.</p>
