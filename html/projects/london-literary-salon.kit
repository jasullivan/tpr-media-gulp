                        <p class="tpr-article-content__details">Client: The London Literary Salon</p>
                        <p class="tpr-article-content__details">Date: July 2021</p>
                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">In the past two years, The Literary Salon (or 'Lit Salon'), a community built around the study of literature and ideas, has discovered a new national and international audience it never knew existed. As the salons went online due to Covid, new participants - affectionately known as 'salonistas' - joined from around the UK as well as the Americas, Australia, France and Hong Kong. The staff team also grew from two to 12 hand-picked facilitators with expertise across plays, poetry, fiction and philosophy. These include actor Jane Wymark and poet Caroline Hammond. In response to this renewed interest in 'slow reading', LitSalon launched an exciting, free 12-month challenge in January 2022 to encourage people to discover new books and poetry throughout the year.</p>
                        <h2 class="tpr-article-content__subtitle">Project:</h2>
                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">tpr media was commissioned by the London Literary Salon founder Toby Brothers to raise the profile and drive a bigger audience to sign up to their online and in-person salons, events and free New Year's reading challenge. Coverage included national and local radio. In January 2022, Toby was interviewed on BBC Radio 4's Start the Week, alongside Michael Igantieff and Christopher Prendergast resulting in thousands of new website visitors and generating extremely positive feedback: “A marvel of a conversation! I appreciate this exchange for many reasons, but mainly because it was so clear and concise about how literature can enlarge us as humans, especially when we are dealing with grief.” In December 2021 and March 2022 Toby was interviewed twice on Times Radio:on the Hugo Rifkind and Michael Portillo shows. She also appeared on BBC Radio London's Robert Elms Show.</p>
