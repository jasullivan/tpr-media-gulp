                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">In this three-part series for Channel 4, Grayson Perry, one of Britain’s leading artists, and winner of the Turner Prize, explored the details of modern life, and the truths those details tell us about ourselves. The work that resulted was Perry’s notorious series of six imposing tapestries called ‘The Vanity of Small Differences’ – his personal but panoramic take on the taste of 21st century Britain.</p>

                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">tpr media’s campaign around the series exceeded press targets, continuing to build in momentum as the series developed. Highlights include features in Sunday Times magazine, Radio Times and a picture-led Eyewitness profile by Charlotte Williamson in the Guardian. Grayson Perry appeared on Radio 4’s Start The Week, the series was reviewed on Saturday Review with Tom Sutcliffe and Perry authored pieces for i, The Times, The Sun and Royal Academy magazine. It also received overwhelmingly positive reviews in nationals and regionals.</p>
