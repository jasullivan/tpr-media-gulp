                        <!-- <p class="tpr-article-content__details">Date: 2021 - 2022</p> -->
                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">What does it take for us to act on the climate crisis – especially if you’re the kind of person who should already be acting?</p>
                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">tpr media are thrilled to be working with the award-winning filmmaker Josh Appignanesi on his latest documentary <a class="tpr-article-content__link" href="https://youtu.be/Xo2vbrKbCTc" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">MY EXTINCTION</a> - the third in an autobiographical trilogy following The New Man and Husband, distributed by Dartmouth Films. </p>  
                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">MY EXTINCTION  is a warm, funny portrait of a self-interested, ineffectual dad who starts to panic about environmental breakdown and ends up getting far more involved in climate action than he'd ever thought possible, culminating in action that brings in Zadie Smith, Mark Rylance, Juliet Stevenson, Simon Schama, and many other leading voices. Appignanesi turns the camera on himself, torn between supporting his family or preserving the planet for his children: “I just don't want them to hate me as we all drown."</p> 

                        <h2 class="tpr-article-content__subtitle">PR campaign:</h2>

                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">tpr media carried out a national campaign with over 40 pieces of coverage between June and July across national and regional press, radio and film publications. The total OTS (opportunity to see) was 29.7M with an advertising value equivalent of £844K (excluding broadcast).</p>
                            
                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">National coverage highlights include authored pieces by Josh Appignanesi in Observer Magazine, the Mirror and The Big Issue. There was an Observer op-ed on climate anxiety by author and psychotherapist Susie Orbach, who appears in the film, as well as a mention in a feature by Hugo Rifkind about climate guilt in The Times. Jewish national coverage included an authored piece for the Jewish Chronicle, a Q&A in the Jewish Telegraph, and an interview in Jewish News. Reviews of MY EXTINCTION were positive, appearing in the Guardian (Peter Bradshaw), The Sunday Times (Ed Porter), The Times Environment newsletter (Henry Bird) and the Morning Star (Maria Duarte). Highlights of reviews in film publications include Total Film, Screen Daily and Vague Visages.</p>
                            
                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">Radio and podcast highlights include interviews on BBC Radio London (Robert Elms), Times Radio (Hugo Rifkind & Ruth Davidson), and podcasts including Steve Richard's Rock and Roll Politics and the Byline Times podcast (Adrian Goldberg) with Peter Pomerantsev, who features in the film. Kermode and Mayo's Take ran a bonus review of MY EXTINCTION and the film was also discussed on Times Radio (Mariella Frostrup) by Larushka Ivan-Zadeh, Metro's Chief Film Critic.</p>
