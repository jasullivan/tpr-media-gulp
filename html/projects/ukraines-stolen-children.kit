                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">"This calm, convincing film leaves outrage in its wake." - The Guardian</p>

                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">It's sobering to be working on Ukraine's Stolen Children from award-winning filmmaker and war correspondent Shahida Tulaganova (Children of Ukraine, Cries From Syria), for ITV's award-winning Exposure current affairs strand. Produced by Renegade Stories, the film tells the chilling story of Ukrainian children taken to Russia after the war and the mothers and relatives who must make the daunting journey into a hostile state to bring them back. Ukraine's Stolen Children explores indoctrination, revealing how children can be weaponised and become another casualty of war. It also includes the first Western TV interview with Maria Lvova-Belova, the Russian Commissioner for Children's Rights, and her fostered son, a Ukrainian orphan.</p>

                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">tpr media carried out a national campaign for the launch of Ukraine's Stolen Children, with coverage on national radio outlets, including BBC Woman's Hour and Times Radio, as well as tabloid newspaper coverage (Daily Mail; Sunday Express) and trade outlets (Broadcast). The documentary was also extensively reviewed, including by national broadsheets (Telegraph; Guardian), which were picked up by online publications (Daily Mail; Yahoo UK & Ireland), and was listed/mentioned in 25+ outlets across the UK and Ireland (inews; The Times; Guardian; Observer Magazine, Daily Mail).</p>
