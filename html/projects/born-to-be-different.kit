                        of the 16-year-old girls were interviewed with their mums on the Lorraine Show and later on BBC Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour,
                        which generated a lot of social media attention. There were over 200 pieces of coverage across all national newspapers
                        and TV listings magazines. tpr media also worked on the 2009 series and built close relationships with the contributors
                        and their families.</p>
