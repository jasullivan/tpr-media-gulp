                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">Ahead of COP27, a radical new ecological project led by an indigenous Colombian community launched at The University of Wales Trinity Saint David as part of the first UNESCO BRIDGES initiative. The aim of this ambitious three-year project is to restore an area of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta mountain range in Colombia to its once flourishing state. It draws entirely on traditional knowledge and forms of understanding unknown to academic science. It will be carried out in partnership with scientists based in Europe observing, reporting, and learning from these proven techniques. This is an opportunity to learn in new ways, offering a route out of disaster.</p>

                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">Colombia's indigenous Kogi people will work with an ecologist and ethno-botanist to jointly regenerate degraded pieces of land, in particular dried water sources that are a result of modern exploitation. The vision is to provide a template for ecological transformation that could be replicated across the world. UNESCO BRIDGES is designed to bring together different forms of knowledge to provide sustainable solutions in this time of crisis.</p>
