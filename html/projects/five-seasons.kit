                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">tpr worked with Dartmouth Films on Five Seasons: The Gardens of Piet Oudolf. Directed by Thomas Piper, the documentary explored the life and work of the most influential landscape designer of the last 50 years. Oudolf is responsible for New Yorkâ€™s High Line and many other iconic urban spaces. Celebrated by gardeners for his revolutionary designs, by ecologists for his significant contributions to biodiversity, by horticulturalists and botanists for his unrivalled knowledge of plants, and by the art, design and fashion worlds for his innovative aesthetics, Piet Oudolf has achieved a level of influence and cultural relevance, rarely, if ever, attained by, in his own words, "a modest plantsman".</p>

                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">tpr media consultants ran a media campaign from March to June 2019 which aimed to generate coverage in national media as well as in the specialist gardening media where Piet Oudolf is undeniably the rock star of landscape gardening. We achieved coverage in the Financial Times and The Sunday Times as well as features in Garden News and Gardening World. The film was extremely well received by critics, receiving four stars in The Times and the Guardian.
