                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">Maramedia's animal documentary series Chasing the Rains is premiered on Sky Nature on 2nd April, 8pm, also available on streaming service NOW. The four-parter follows the intricate stories of three animal matriarchs in Kenya's wild lands as they protect their families during one of the worst droughts in 20 years. Water is life, the elixir without which nothing can survive, but as climate change wreaks havoc, even more ingenuity, resilience and strength will be needed to see the animal families survive. The series is narrated by award-winning actress Adjoa Andoh (Bridgerton, Invictus) and is filmed in stunning 4K UHD.
