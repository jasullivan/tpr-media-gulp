                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">Since 2012, we’ve been working on Callum Macrae’s Emmy and Nobel-nominated documentary film No Fire Zone. The
                        product of a three-year investigation, the film documents the horrific human rights abuses committed in the closing
                        weeks of civil war in Sri Lanka in 2009.</p>
                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">We’re extremely proud to have managed an ongoing UK and international news and current affairs press campaign for No
                            Fire Zone, which has raised international awareness and even helped to play a key role in convincing the UN
                        Human Rights Council in March 2014 to launch a major international war crimes investigation into the atrocities.</p>

                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">In addition to securing hundreds of articles, features and reports in newspapers, magazines and websites worldwide –
                        from The New York Times to The Times of India – as well as over 50 television interviews with Callum
                        Macrae, No Fire Zone’s social media campaign was also visible with the feature-length documentary widely
                        tweeted about, from politicians to high profile celebrities, trending both in the United Kingdom and India.</p>
                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">British Prime Minister, David Cameron, released the following statement on seeing the film and called for an
                        independent investigation: "No Fire Zone is one of the most chilling documentaries I’ve watched...Many of the
                            images are truly shocking...This documentary raises very serious questions that the Sri Lankan government must
                            answer about what it did to protect innocent civilians. Questions that strengthen the case for an independent
                            investigation. Questions that need answers if Sri Lanka is to build the truly peaceful and inclusive future its
                            people deserve."</p>
