                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">For the first time, a live-action TV adaptation of Michael Bond's (creator of Paddington) beloved Olga da Polga books was broadcast on CBeebies from the 14th November 2022. Produced by Glasgow-based production company Maramedia, it tells the adventurous, funny and imaginative tales of Olga the guinea pig and features an eclectic cast of loveable animal and human characters. Olga narrates her wild - and often over-exaggerated - adventures to her animal friends who find that life with Olga is certainly never dull.</p>

                        <h2 class="tpr-article-content__subtitle">Campaign Overview:</h2>

                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">tpr worked with Maramedia on the launch of their new CBeebies series, Olga da Polga in the run up to Christmas 2022. We carried out a broad-ranging, high-visibility campaign targeting a range of outlets across TV, radio, broadsheets and mid-market tabloids as well as trade and regional press.</p>

                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">The campaign launched with a strong feature in the Observer (print and online), the story had a full page spread based on an interview with Karen Jankel (Michael Bond's daughter) and a selection of photos. Other print coverage included an article on Julie Wilson Nimmo in the Daily Mirror on her comeback to children's television. A similar story was shared in the Sun, OK! and the Daily Star in the following days.</p>

                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">Broadcast coverage for the project included BBC Breakfast, Radio 4's Today programme and BBC Scotland's The Nine, also interviewed actors Julie Wilson Nimmo and Greg Hemphill.</p>

                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">There was also a range of regional press coverage including a feature in Scotland's paper the Sunday Post, the Glasgow Times and Glasgow Live. Trade press included a Behind the Scenes feature in Broadcast magazine by production team members Jackie and Fiona as well as a C21 media piece and a piece in The Agency.</p>
