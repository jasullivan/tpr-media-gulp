                        <p class="tpr-article-content__details">Festival: 64th BFI London Film Festival</p>
                        <p class="tpr-article-content__details">Date: 11 October 2020</p>
                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">Eyimofe (This is My Desire) was selected as one of only 50 films to be screened at the virtual 64th 2020 BFI London Film Festival (the number is usually 300). This directorial debut from twin brothers Arie and Chuko Esiri showcased the exciting genre of new&#8208;wave Nigerian cinema from GDN Studios. Eyimofe is a film about the quest of two people, Mofe and Rosa, living in the sprawling metropolis of Lagos, for what they believe will be a better life on foreign shores. However, tragedy and fate intervene as they try to better the lives of their families.</p>
                        <h2 class="tpr-article-content__subtitle">Project: </h2>
                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">tpr media was commissioned by Renegade Pictures to carry out a broad&#8208;ranging, mainstream campaign in order to raise the profile and drive viewers for the Channel 4 programming of Surviving the Stone Age. Despite a tight 10&#8208;day turnaround, there were 70 pieces of coverage including features, previews, trade press, TV and radio interviews.</p>
                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">This high&#8208;end, reputational media campaign focused specifically on film press and higher end print and radio. We were initially asked to organise a private event for the film's UK premiere alongside the PR campaign but this did not go ahead due to Covid restrictions. We placed 15 features and reviews across a range of online publications as a radio interview with the lead Jude Akuwudike on BBC Radio 4's Saturday Live. Key pieces included a BFI Sight and Sound feature on Nigerian New Wave cinema which included interviews with the directors, together with a review, a British Blacklist interview with Arie and Chuko and an Alt A Review Q&A with Jude Akuwudike. There was coverage across a number of film blogs.
