                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph tpr-article-content__paragraph--blog">At tpr, we continue our work with the International Truth and Justice Project (ITJP), an inspiring human rights organisation who work to protect and promote justice and accountability in Sri Lanka. Amidst the escalating protests and economic crisis in Sri Lanka, there are continued calls for President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to resign. The Rajapaksa government stands accused of overseeing rampant corruption and numerous human rights violations. Alongside Journalists for Democracy in Sri Lanka (JDS), the ITJP have released their shocking new report which details the President's role in mass atrocities, enforced disappearances and torture more than three decades ago alongside survivor and family testimonies.</p>

                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph tpr-article-content__paragraph--blog">In 1989, Gotabaya Rajapaksa was the district military coordinator of the Matale district in the Central Province, with command responsibility when at least 700 people – mainly Sinhalese – were subjected to enforced disappearance. We have worked alongside the ITJP and JDS to help publicise this new report. It's important that the President's involvement in human rights offences is made public and he and his regime are held to account.
