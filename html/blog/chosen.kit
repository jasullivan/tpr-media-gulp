                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph tpr-article-content__paragraph--blog">Peter Wright former headmaster of Caldicott Preparatory school, attended by Deputy Prime Minister, Nick Clegg, was sentenced yesterday to eight years in jail following a trial in which he was found guilty of sexually abusing five pupils.</p>

                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph tpr-article-content__paragraph--blog">In 2008 tpr media consultants worked on Chosen a feature-length documentary made by TrueVision, which brought to light this shocking abuse of power. In this extraordinary documentary, three men, Tom, Mark and Alastair, broke their silence to tell the story of how they were groomed and sexually abused by Peter Wright while pupils at Caldicott Preparatory school decades after the event. Furthermore the documentary looks at how common it is for these abuses to go undetected and the failure of current regulations, these men demand for legal action to put in place by those who do not report these sexual attacks.</p>

                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph tpr-article-content__paragraph--blog">It has taken thirty-seven years after the abuses took place, and one failed attempt at prosecution for Wright to be convicted and sentenced. One contributor, Tom Perry, said: "I think it sends a very strong message to those people who are abusers of children, that you can get to the age of 83 and get eight years. I'm pleased with the sentence only for that reason."</p>

                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph tpr-article-content__paragraph--blog">Tom Perry is now campaigning for mandatory reporting to be introduced to ensure any teacher suspecting sexual abuse of a child in their school must raise the alarm. Tom said mandatory reporting was particularly necessary in the independent sector because: "fee-receiving institutions are presented with a conflict of interest over reporting, because it is discretionary."

                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph tpr-article-content__paragraph--blog">"The best film about sexual abuse I have ever seen. Never have male survivors spoken so articulately and movingly about their most painful and private experiences."  – Dr Pamela Stephenson.</p>

                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph tpr-article-content__paragraph--blog">Sadly one of the contributors, Mark Payge, didn't live to see Wright sentenced. He died of cancer last year.</p>
