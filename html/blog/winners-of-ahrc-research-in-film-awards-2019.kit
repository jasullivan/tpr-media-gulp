Spirit follows Saraswati, the first educated daughter-in-law to marry into the village 20 years ago and wondered how she could ever belong. Ross Harrison and Dr Jane Dyson worked together on the film to reveal that belonging cannot be assumed, but is the slow alchemy of work, friendship, love, loss and belief.</p>
