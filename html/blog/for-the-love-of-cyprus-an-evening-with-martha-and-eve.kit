                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph tpr-article-content__paragraph--blog">We have the pleasure of working with award-winning music-comedy duo Martha and Eve again (Martha D.Lewis and Eve Polycarpou, formerly known as Donna and Kebab) for an exciting three-day event ‘For the Love of Cyprus’, a celebration of the duo’s Cypriot roots and desire for unity and peace on the 50th anniversary of the division of the island. </p>

                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph tpr-article-content__paragraph--blog">For over 30 years, Martha and Eve have been performing both individually and as a double act, winning accolades, awards and touring the world. Martha and Eve have curated three special evenings and invited some of their favourite artists to perform, who, like them, share a special connection to Cyprus.</p>

                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph tpr-article-content__paragraph--blog">"We’re so excited to return to Theatro Technis, the venue where we began our journey over 30 years ago. It’s such a pleasure to be performing with some of the greats from our Cypriot community, especially on a project so close to our hearts."</p>
