                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph tpr-article-content__paragraph--blog">We love working with the many dedicated researchers at the University of West London. For this project, we teamed up with Professor Graeme Atherton, Head of the Centre for Inequality and Levelling Up (CEILUP) at UWL for the launch of a new report How Can Labour Level Up?Â </p>

                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph tpr-article-content__paragraph--blog">Comprising 13 essays from think tanks, NGOs, and politicians from across the political spectrum, the report urges Labour to be bolder on levelling up if they want to attract voters in key seats that will decide the next election.</p>

                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph tpr-article-content__paragraph--blog">Levelling Up was at the heart of the Conservative government's domestic agenda when they were elected in 2019. Yet with 1 in 3 children living in poverty in the UK and over 2.1 million households now using food banks, the UK is set to become the most unequal country in the G7 by 2027.</p>
                        
                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph tpr-article-content__paragraph--blog">The launch will be held at The House of Commons last night, hosted by Alex Norris MP, Shadow Minister for Levelling Up. Graeme Atherton was joined by Justine Greening, Professor Peter John CBE, Lord John Bird and Dan Norris.</p>
