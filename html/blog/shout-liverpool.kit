                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph tpr-article-content__paragraph--blog">We're thrilled to be working on SHOUT, the annual <a class="tpr-article-content__link" href="https://www.ashfordplace.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ashford Place</a> Mental Health Film & Arts Festival. Following the success of SHOUT LONDON, SHOUT LIVERPOOL will be taking place on Thursday 18 and Friday 19 April at <a class="tpr-article-content__link" href="https://www.thebluecoat.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bluecoat</a>, Liverpool's contemporary arts centre. This ticketed free-to-attend event showcases original artistic content across film (features and shorts), theatre, dance, spoken word, music and other art forms from Liverpool and across the UK by people with lived experience of mental health issues.</p>


                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph tpr-article-content__paragraph--blog">SHOUT LIVERPOOL 2024 will be curated by Festival Director Carey Fitzgerald, CEO of Silver Mountain Productions who, along with the Arts Council England, the Department of Foreign Affairs Ireland, Irish Community Car, i2i Media and Flannery Plant Hire will act as sponsors. Actor Michelle Collins will continue as Festival Patron, as will actor, dancer and award-winning writer Maria McAteer, accompanied by Alice Beadle on the violin.</p>

                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph tpr-article-content__paragraph--blog">The festival will open with a scene from McAteer's play THE GUINNESS GIRL, which was a huge success at the London Irish Centre and is soon to be made into a feature film.</p>
