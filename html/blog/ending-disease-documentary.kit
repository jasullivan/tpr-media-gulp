                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph tpr-article-content__paragraph--blog">We're delighted to be working again with Emmy award-winning filmmaker Joe Gantz on his latest feature-length documentary film (in April we worked on The Race to Save the World about climate change activists). Ending Disease explores a revolution in medicine, with research that affects every single one of us.</p>

                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph tpr-article-content__paragraph--blog">Joe was granted unprecedented access to ten of the first generation of FDA-approved clinical trials for stem cell, CAR-T cell, and antibody therapies. These therapies have the ability to take us from a lifetime of treatments to one-time cures for some of the most intractable medical conditions: from cancer to blindness. Times Radio interviewed filmmaker Joe along with Ryan, who features in the film, and talks about improvements to his mobility following a major spine injury and the Guardian <a class="tpr-article-content__link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/nov/02/ending-disease-review-stem-cell-research" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reviewed</a> the film.</p>

                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph tpr-article-content__paragraph--blog">It was so inspiring to speak to the ‘father’ of stem cell biology, Dr Irv Weissman, as part of the research for this campaign. Ending Disease is available globally across selected VOD platforms including Apple iTunes and Google Play. See the trailer <a class="tpr-article-content__link" href="https://vimeo.com/465162755" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
