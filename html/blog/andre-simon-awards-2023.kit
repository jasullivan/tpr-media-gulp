                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph tpr-article-content__paragraph--blog">Each year tpr media work with the Andr&#233; Simon trustees and assessors to promote the prestigious awards. The awards have now been running for over four decades and showcase the very best of contemporary food and drink writing. This year we were able to celebrate the awards in person for the first time in three years. The event held at The Don Restaurant in central London was attended by authors, publishers, press, friends and family, it was a truly uplifting and inspiring evening. This year’s food award went to the brilliant Jeremy Lee for his long-awaited first book COOKING: Simply and well, for one or many, a masterclass in simple everyday ingredients. Jennifer Regan-Lefebvre bagged this year’s Drink Award, for Imperial Wine, a lesson on the colonial roots of the international wine trade. The John Avery Award went to Mo Wilde for The Wilderness Cure, a diary of a year lived entirely off foraged food in Scotland. The Special Commendation Award showcased the precise art of croissant making in Kate Reid’s Lune: Croissants All Day, All Night. </p>
