                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph tpr-article-content__paragraph--blog">This month, for the first time, we have been working with Professor Katie Featherstone, Director of the University of West London's Geller Institute of Ageing and Memory on their latest in-depth research. Their new study shines a light on the taboo subject of continence care among people living with dementia in acute wards and the often-irreversible impact on individuals, their dignity, their families and society at large. The year-long study found that people living with dementia are routinely put in continence pads regardless of their bathroom needs or independence. As a result of this 'pad culture' many people living with dementia who are continent at admission are at significant risk of developing incontinence during their hospital stay, with this becoming permanent at discharge. This can lead to patients moving into long-term supported care, the break up of families, homes and care networks.</p>

BBC News also ran an article <a class="tpr-article-content__link" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-61826067" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. As well as this, Katie was interviewed on BBC Radio 4â€™s PM. There was also a detailed discussion on Times Radio.
