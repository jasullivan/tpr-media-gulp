                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">We were privileged to have been involved in the release of Dartmouth Films' new documentary <a class="tpr-article-content__link" href="http://theballymurphyprecedent.com/trailer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Ballymurphy Precedent</a> in UK and Irish cinemas and Channel 4 this Sunday (9 September). This documentary is directed by Callum Macrae who tpr media worked with on No Fire Zone: The Killing Fields of Sri Lanka. The Ballymurphy Precedent is a forensic expos√© of one of the most shocking events of the Troubles in Northern Ireland. It tells the story of the death of eleven innocent people killed by the British Army on a Catholic estate in Belfast in 1971, and the fight by their relatives and survivors to discover the truth. This is a massacre few have heard of, yet it was one of the most significant events of the Troubles, coming as it did in the first days of internment and six months before Bloody Sunday. The Ballymurphy Precedent has been released ahead of a new inquest into the deaths, which is set to start later this month. While the inquest cannot establish criminal responsibility, it can determine whether the force used was justified or not. For relatives, the inquest would be the first real step to getting to the truth in nearly 50 years.</p>
