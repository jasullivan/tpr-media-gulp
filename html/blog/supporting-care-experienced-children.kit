                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph tpr-article-content__paragraph--blog">Once again we are delighted to work with Andy Glynne, Founder and CEO of BAFTA award-winning production company Mosaic Films, who pioneered the use of animation to tell mental health stories using real-life testimonies voiced by their subjects. Mosaic Films’ latest animated series for <a class="tpr-article-content__link" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/teach/teacher-support/supporting-care-experienced-children/z7pmnk7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BBC Teach</a> directed by Glynne, is designed to help primary and secondary teachers support care-experienced young people, comprising real testimonies voiced by children who have experienced the care system.</p>

                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph tpr-article-content__paragraph--blog">Mosaic Films explores a range of sensitive topics, including <a class="tpr-article-content__link" href="https://www.mosaicfilms.com/digital/bbc-teach-my-troubled-mind" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mental illness</a> and <a class="tpr-article-content__link" href="https://www.mosaicfilms.com/digital/bbc-seeking-refuge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the child refugee experience</a> and <a class="tpr-article-content__link" href="https://www.mosaicfilms.com/digital/stories-of-postnatal-depression" target="_blank" rel="noopener">postnatal depression</a>. The production company’s original award-winning <a class="tpr-article-content__link" href="https://www.animatedminds.com/original-animated-minds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Animated Minds</a> series for Channel 4 - a collection of short-form animated documentaries on mental health - was the first of its kind on UK television. This earned the company three BAFTAs and two Royal Television Society Awards, as well as endorsements from the likes of Stephen Fry, and other leading influencers in the field of mental health.</p>
