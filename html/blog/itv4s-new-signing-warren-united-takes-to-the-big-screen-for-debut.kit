                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph tpr-article-content__paragraph--blog">Warren United is set to broadcast to the 22 April to kick off with the UEFA Champions League semi-finals. The six parts series follows the fortunes of Warren Kingsley, an overweight kitchen salesman and fervent football fan, as he stumbles through life trying to juggle his two passions – football and family. Warren is a bloke of two halves: both a devoted husband and dad and a diehard fan of Brainsford United, a chronically struggling club, known to its long-suffering fans as "The Meringues."</p>

                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph tpr-article-content__paragraph--blog">"It's about the two most important f's in life – family and football," says executive producer Bill Freedman, Warren has been his brainchild for over eight years. "This show is also about the passion of being a fan. Yes, supporting Brainsford United often brings Warren more pain than joy but that's what makes him a true fan."</p>
