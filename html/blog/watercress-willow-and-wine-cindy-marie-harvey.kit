                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph tpr-article-content__paragraph--blog">At tpr media we love working on food and drink projects and they always inspire us to try new things. This summer we began work on Watercress, Willow and Wine by Cindy-Marie Harvey. This new food and wine book celebrates the renaissance of English wine - we were intrigued to discover that exports of English wine rose by over 50% in the 12 months from September 2020 and the number of domestic vineyards stands at over 800 and growing!</p>

                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph tpr-article-content__paragraph--blog">In the book Cindy-Marie explores her favourite wine estates and sustainable local ingredients from the picturesque Cornwall and Dorset to less traditional Urban wineries. Accompanying recipes support the philosophy of Slow Food (‘Good, Clean and Fair’) from watercress scones to scallop pies.</p>

                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph tpr-article-content__paragraph--blog">Cindy-Marie turns her attention to wine and produce on her very own doorstep as more producers open their vineyards and wine estates to visitors and embrace sustainable practices. We had the pleasure of visiting one of the featured vineyards, Nutbourne, and sampled some delicious wines and local produce as well as taking a tour round the estate.</p>
