                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph tpr-article-content__paragraph--blog">We're so excited to be able to announce the new appointment of Hannah Price and Mark Ravenhill as joint artistic directors of the King's Head Theatre ahead of the venue's 2022 historic venue move. tpr Media has worked with Islington's renowned pub theatre for over a year and a half now, it is fantastic to see visions for an even more inclusive and diverse future come to life. The new creative team pledges to produce work that: "Allows us all to imagine a better future".</p>

                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph tpr-article-content__paragraph--blog">Mark Ravenhill and Hannah Price, who applied for the position together, said: "Along with many others, we've reappraised our priorities over the last year of lockdown. With the disruption of theatre work and its devastating impact on both institutions and freelance workers, we felt that now was the time to roll up our sleeves and be part of the rebuilding of our industry. We're excited by the possibilities of producing new work at the Kingâ€™s Head and of generating new employment possibilities and audiences as it prepares for its move to a bigger theatre in 2022. We want to produce work that is joyful, irreverent, colourful and queer and which allows us all to imagine a better future."</p>

                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph tpr-article-content__paragraph--blog">This innovative collaboration is part of a new mode of working in the creative industries prompted by lockdown, where two people share one high-profile role, increasing creativity and productivity. Mark and Hannah will join Executive Director Fiona English as joint CEOs.</p>

                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph tpr-article-content__paragraph--blog">Fiona English remarked: "We are thrilled that Hannah and Mark are joining us. There have only been three artistic directors in the theatre's history since it was founded in 1970: Dan Crawford, Stephanie Sinclaire Lightsmith and Adam Spreadbury-Maher. Hannah and Mark are the perfect pair to continue their rich legacy."</p>

                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph tpr-article-content__paragraph--blog">The final season in the King's Head pub theatre, beginning in April 2022, will be the first programmed by Hannah and Mark. Plans for the new venue, alongside headline productions of new work, include a summer Queer School in which young people who identify as LGBTQ+ will be taught a queer curriculum not included in mainstream schooling.</p>
