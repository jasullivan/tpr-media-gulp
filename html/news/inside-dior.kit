                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">We've had a busy start to the year at tpr media. Last month we celebrated the <a class="tpr-article-content__link" href="http://www.andresimon.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">André Simon Food &amp; Drink Book Awards</a> at the Goring Hotel, where Chinese food expert Fuchsia Dunlop and Bake Off talent Ruby Tandoh both won prizes. We loved getting stuck into all the shortlisted publications, but our "tpr hot pick" would have to be <a class="tpr-article-content__link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Longthroat-Memoirs-Soups-Nigerian-Taste/dp/191111526X" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Longthroat Memoirs: Soups, Sex and Nigerian Taste Buds</a>, a fascinating read by emerging African food writer Yemisi Aribisala.</p>
                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">We also enjoyed learning about what went on behind the scenes during the filming of Danny Boyle's T2 Trainspotting from our SFX client <a class="tpr-article-content__link" href="http://www.artem.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Artem</a> – the coolest team in the business. Guardian columnist Zoe Williams visited Artem's London studios to <a class="tpr-article-content__link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jan/29/blood-guts-and-fireballs-t2-trainspotting-special-effects-artem" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">find out more</a> about how the creative technicians went about building blood rigs, a breakable toilet(!) and an impressive range of atmospheric effects.</p>

                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">Alongside this, we've been working on Fiona Murphy's informative and passionate documentary, <a class="tpr-article-content__link" href="http://rememberbaghdad.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remember Baghdad</a>, which presents an unmissable insight into the story of Iraq through the eyes of the Jews who lived there for 2,600 years until only a generation ago. We're looking forward to a lively festival season, bringing the film to wider audiences and attracting the recognition we believe it deserves.</p>

                        <p style="text-align: center;">In the run-up to London Fashion Week (17-21 February 2017), the series takes an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at Dior's billion-dollar brand on its 70th birthday, providing a talking point for discussions about fashion and female identity. Director Michael Waldman revealed more about the filming in a blog post for <a class="tpr-article-content__link" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/michael-waldman1/inside-dior_b_14653016.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Huffington Post</a>.</p>
