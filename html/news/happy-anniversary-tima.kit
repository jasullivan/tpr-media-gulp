                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">We’re very excited to announce that this week our client TIMA – The International Media Associates - is celebrating its third anniversary of their Washington, DC offices.</p>

                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">Since launching its Washington bureau, TIMA has covered other landmark events from the city, including the run up to the re-election of Barack Obama, both from the studio – with its amazing roof top view of the White House for live positions – and from key locations across the city. TIMA’s Washington bureau has 5,500 square metres of fully-equipped workspace for journalists and producers, and editing facilities and a master control room. Satellite and fibre circuits connect TIMA studios across the US to London and to South America – including studio facilities and logistical support, to broadcasters and online publishers. In addition to this, TIMA’s new Flydrive satellite uplink unit can be deployed quickly to breaking news and special events across Central and South America.</p>

                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">As well as its own facilities and content services, TIMA also provides location services in partnership with Reuters. Reuters-TIMA Location Services launched at the 87th Academy Awards ceremony in Los Angeles earlier this year. This means TIMA’s Washington bureau is part of a network across the US which includes Reuters bureau in New York’s Times Square and TIMA’s dedicated UN facility, also in New York.</p>

                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">Reuters-TIMA recently covered events for international clients from their Washington and New York offices, including the papal visit to the US and the 70th United Nations General Assembly. Reuters-TIMA are also preparing for 2016, when they will be offering live facilities to broadcasters and online publishers in the run up to and duration of the United States presidential election.</p>

                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">Huge congratulations to CEO Alla and all the TIMA team for a fantastic three years, we’re very excited for what’s to come.</p>
