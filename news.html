                        Baghdad. This fascinating film tells the story of Iraq through the eyes of the last Jews of Baghdad, who lived there
                        for 2,600 years until only a generation ago. With vivid home movies and footage from Iraq today, eight characters tell
                        their remarkable story. We held the event at the impressive Jewish community centre, JW3, where almost 300 people
                        attended.</p>

                <p><span>Christopher Hird, Founder/Managing Director, Dartmouth Films</span> <br>"It is always a great challenge to get media attention for an independent documentary. The key is strategically focusing on the coverage which gets the attention of your target audience. tpr excel at this, helping to fill cinemas for us."</p>
                <p><span>Paul Elson, CEO, Brave New Media</span> <br>"I have worked with Sophie and tpr media for four years now, and by choice would not work with anyone else. Sophie has the experience which gives me confidence not only that a campaign will go well, but that she will go above and beyond what a normal PR agency does to make sure the campaign is a success."</p>
